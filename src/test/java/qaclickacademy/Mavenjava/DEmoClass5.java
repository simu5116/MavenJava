		 * MaxInstances This says....how many instances of same version of browser can
		 * run over the Remote System.
		 * 
		 * For example, i have a FF12,IE and i declared the command as follows -browser
		 * browserName=firefox,version=12,maxInstances=5,platform=LINUX -browser
		 * browserName=InternetExplorer,version=9.0,maxInstances=5,platform=LINUX So i
		 * can run 5 instances of Firefox 12 and as well as 5 instances of IE9 at the
		 * same time in remote machine. So total user can run 10 instances of different
		 * browsers (FF12 & IE9) in parallel.
		 * 
		 * MaxSession This says....how many browsers (Any Browser and any version) can
		 * run in parallel at a time in the remote system. So this overrides the Max
		 * Instances settings and can restrict the number of browser instances that can
		 * run in parallel.
		 * 
		 * For above example, when maxSession=1 forces that you never have more than 1
		 * browser running.
		 * 
		 * With maxSession=2 you can have 2 Firefox tests at the same time, or 1
		 * Internet Explorer and
